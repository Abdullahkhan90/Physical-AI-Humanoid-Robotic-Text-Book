# Welcome to the AI Native Textbook on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

This textbook provides a comprehensive guide to understanding and working with Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics through hands-on experiences in simulated and real-world environments.

## Course Modules

This textbook is structured into four core modules:

### [Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)](./module-1-ros2/intro.md)
Learn about the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) as the middleware for robot control. Covering topics like ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services, bridging Python Agents to ROS controllers, and URDF for Humanoids.

### [Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)](./module-2-digital-twin/intro.md)
Explore physics simulation and environment building using Gazebo and Unity. Learn to simulate physics, gravity, and collisions, as well as high-fidelity rendering for human-robot interaction.

### [Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)](./module-3-ai-brain/intro.md)
Delve into advanced perception and training using NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS for VSLAM, and Nav2 for path planning for humanoid movement.

### [Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)](./module-4-vla/intro.md)
Discover the convergence of LLMs and Robotics through OpenAI Whisper for voice commands and cognitive planning for natural language processing.
