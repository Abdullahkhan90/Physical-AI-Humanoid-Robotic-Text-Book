# Introduction to ROS 2

Welcome to the first module of our AI Native Textbook on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. This module focuses on the Robotic Nervous System, specifically the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2).

## Overview

The Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) is a flexible framework for writing robot applications. It is a successor to ROS (Robot Operating System), designed to support a wider range of robot platforms and use cases. Unlike traditional operating systems, ROS 2 is middleware that provides services designed for a heterogeneous computer cluster, including hardware abstraction, device drivers, libraries, visualizers, message-passing, package management, and more.

ROS 2 is composed of a collection of packages that provide implementations for various components of a distributed robotic system. These components include:

- Communication layers for exchanging messages between processes
- Tools for introspecting and debugging the system
- Hardware abstraction capabilities
- Device driver interfaces

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:
- Understand the ROS 2 architecture and how it facilitates robotic control
- Implement communication patterns using nodes, topics, and services
- Integrate Python-based AI agents with ROS controllers using `rclpy`
- Model humanoid robots using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)

## Topics Covered

- ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services
- Bridging Python Agents to ROS controllers using rclpy
- URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) for Humanoids

## Prerequisites

Before beginning this module, you should have:
- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Familiarity with command-line interfaces
- Knowledge of basic robotics concepts

## Next Steps
