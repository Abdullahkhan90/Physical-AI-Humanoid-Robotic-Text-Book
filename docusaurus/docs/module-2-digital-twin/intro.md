# The Digital Twin: Physics Simulation and Environment Building

The digital twin concept involves creating a virtual replica of a physical system. In robotics, this means having a virtual representation of a robot that mirrors its physical counterpart. This module focuses on using Gazebo and Unity for creating realistic physics simulations and environments for robots.

## Overview

Creating a digital twin of a robot has numerous benefits:
- Testing control algorithms in a safe environment
- Prototyping robot designs without building hardware
- Training AI agents before deployment to real robots
- Predictive maintenance and performance optimization

The digital twin bridges the gap between the virtual and physical worlds, allowing for extensive testing and development before actual deployment.
