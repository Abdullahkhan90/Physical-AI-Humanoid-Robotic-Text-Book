# AI Native Textbook Project - Successfully Running

## Summary
The AI Native Textbook on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics project is now successfully running. Here's what was accomplished:

### Issues Fixed
1. **npm installation issues on Windows**: Resolved network and permission errors during npm install
2. **Theme import errors**: Fixed incorrect import paths for prism-react-renderer themes
3. **Missing CSS file**: Created the required `src/css/custom.css` file
4. **Invalid JSON syntax**: Fixed the `_category_.json` file that contained JavaScript instead of JSON
5. **TypeScript syntax in JSX files**: Removed TypeScript type annotations from JSX files

### Current Status
- ✅ Docusaurus development server is running on http://localhost:3000/ai-textbook-physical-ai-humanoid/
