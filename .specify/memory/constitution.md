# AI Native Textbook on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Constitution

## Core Principles

### Accuracy
Accuracy through primary source verification, with a strong focus on real-world applications. All content must be fact-checked against reliable sources with citations provided for verification.

### Clarity
Clarity for a technical audience with backgrounds in AI, robotics, and engineering. Content must be expressed in clear, understandable language appropriate for university-level students and professionals in the field.

### Reproducibility
Reproducibility of all processes and experiments, with full traceability of claims. All experimental results, algorithms, and examples must be reproducible with sufficient detail and code where applicable.

### Rigor
Peer-reviewed sources and credible publications for scientific integrity. All content must meet academic standards of scholarly research and evidence-based information.

### Verification
All factual claims must be traceable to reliable and verifiable sources. Each technical assertion must be backed by authoritative academic or industry references.

### Plagiarism-Free Content
Zero tolerance for plagiarism before submission. All content must be original or properly attributed with clear citations following academic standards.

## Key Standards

- Citation format: APA style for all references.
- Source types: At least 50% of sources must be peer-reviewed journal articles, conference papers, or industry standards.
- Writing clarity: Writing should aim for a Flesch-Kincaid grade level of 12-14 for technical clarity and readability.
- Minimum 25 sources, with diversity in source types (journals, books, online standards).

## Constraints and Success Criteria

- Word count: 15,000-20,000 words (to cover all course modules comprehensively).
- Format: Published via Docusaurus and deployed to GitHub Pages; chapters available in Markdown format with embedded citations.
- Deadline: First draft to be submitted within 3 months.
- Success criteria: Technical claims verified from credible sources, no plagiarism, passes internal review, successful RAG chatbot integration, published book accessible on GitHub Pages, ability for students to personalize content and translate chapters into Urdu.

## Governance

Constitution supersedes all other practices. All content must verify compliance with accuracy, clarity, reproducibility, rigor, and verification standards. Use standard academic practices for research, referencing, and verification. All contributions must undergo peer review before acceptance.
